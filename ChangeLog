2019-xx In progress
	* Bug fix: correcting friend declaration signature of vector variant of assign
	* Bug fix: enabling mask complements in row/col variants of assign
	* Bug fix: detect distance updates in current bin of delta stepping SSSP algorithm
	* Refactor: Changed how nsver is subtracted from result vector in BC algorithm (vertex_betweenness_centrality_batch_alt_trans_v2())
	* Addition: Single-source parent BFS (with more efficient index-of() operation)
	* Addition: Single-source level BFS algorithm (appendix B.2 of C API Spec. v1.2)
	* Addition: Triangle counting algorithm: masked, that takes L and U matrices (no transpose).
	* Addition: Filtered Bellman-Ford SSSP algorithm
	* Addition: Start of optimized sequential (single-threaded) backend: more efficient code branches (24) for mxm, mxm timing tests

2018-07 Scott McMillan <smcmillan@sei.cmu.edu>
	* Version 2.0 Release (merged from spiral_graph branch to master).
	* API revamped to implement the functionality included in GraphBLAS C API spec
	* All algorithms revamped to be more "GraphBLAS-ified".
	* Substantially more unit tests added.
	* New algorithms added like maxflow, delta-stepping SSSP, etc.
	* Support for GPU backend removed.
	* Build system switched from autotools to cmake.
